# ? This are different types of datastructures : 
# ? list - sequence of mutable values : means we can change the values in the list : can add and remove item to and from the list
# tuple - sequence of immutable values: is the antonym of list : can't add and remove item to or from the list
# set - collection of unique value
#? dict-dictionary : collection of key value pair : in the real world the key is the 'word' we want to look up and the value is it's definition ---- any time we want to map something to some other value we can very easily look up for that value inside of this datastructures
